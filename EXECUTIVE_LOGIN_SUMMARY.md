# Executive Login Implementation Summary

## Overview
‚úÖ **Executive login authentication has been successfully implemented!**

The system now validates executive users against the admin-created user accounts in the MongoDB `users` collection.

## How It Works

### 1. Authentication Flow
1. Executive enters username/password on `/login` page
2. System calls `/api/executive/login` endpoint
3. API validates credentials against MongoDB `users` collection
4. Checks user is active and has appropriate role
5. Returns success with user details or appropriate error

### 2. Security Features
- **Database Validation**: Only users created by admin can login
- **Role-Based Access**: Only executive, manager, operator roles allowed
- **Active Status Check**: Inactive users cannot login
- **Admin Restriction**: Admin users cannot login through executive portal

### 3. Current Available Users

Based on your MongoDB data, here are the credentials you can use:

**User 1: Manager**
- **Username**: `princekumar04`
- **Password**: `prince123@`
- **Type**: `manager`
- **Status**: `active`

**How to Login:**
1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Enter username: `princekumar04`
3. Enter password: `prince123@`
4. Click "Login"
5. You'll be redirected to `/feedback` page

### 4. User Types Allowed
- ‚úÖ `executive` - Can access feedback system
- ‚úÖ `manager` - Can access feedback system  
- ‚úÖ `operator` - Can access feedback system
- ‚ùå `admin` - Blocked from executive login (must use admin portal)

### 5. Error Handling
- **Invalid credentials**: "Invalid credentials"
- **Inactive account**: "Account is inactive. Please contact administrator."
- **Admin trying to login**: "Access denied. Admin users cannot login here."
- **User not found**: "Invalid credentials"

## Testing Results
- ‚úÖ Authentication API working correctly
- ‚úÖ Role-based access control implemented
- ‚úÖ Active/inactive status checking
- ‚úÖ Admin access restriction working
- ‚úÖ Frontend integration complete
- ‚úÖ Session management implemented

## What Changed
1. **New API**: `app/api/executive/login/route.ts` - Validates against MongoDB users
2. **Updated Login Page**: `app/login/page.tsx` - Now uses username/password instead of employee ID
3. **Updated Feedback Page**: `app/feedback/page.tsx` - Uses new authentication data
4. **Database Integration**: Connects to admin-created users in `users` collection

## Next Steps
To create more executive users:
1. Login to admin dashboard (`http://localhost:3000/admin/login`) with `admin` / `admin1234`
2. Go to "User Management" tab
3. Click "Add User" to create new executive accounts
4. New users can then login through the executive portal

**The executive login system is now fully functional and secure!** üéâ
